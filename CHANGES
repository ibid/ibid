Release 0.1.1 (in development)
==============================

Resolved Security Issues
------------------------

Remote Execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:bug:`705860`:
  Permissions were ignored for handlers not using :func:`@match
  <ibid.plugins.match>`.
  This allowed users to perform actions they were not authorised to.

  However, no included plugins were exposed by this, all
  access-restricted handlers used :func:`@match <ibid.plugins.match>`.

Information Disclosure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:bug:`567576`:
  Occasionally insecure permissions on log files.
  When the bot spoke first (creating a new log file), the log file would
  be publicly readable, even if the message was sent in private.

  Example:
  If the bot delivered a *privmsg* memo to a user at the beginning of
  the month, it would create the logfile with public readable
  permissions.
  If the logfile directory was published by a web server, this would
  make this private conversation log accessible to the public.

  Resolution: Now channels must be explicitly configured to have
  publicly readable logs.

:bug:`649383`:
  If someone received a private message from the bot
  during a public meeting, the message could appear in the meeting
  minutes.

  Example: a *privmsg* memo received during a meeting would appear in
  the minutes.
