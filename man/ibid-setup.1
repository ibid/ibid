.TH IBID-SETUP "1" "January 2010" "Ibid 0.0" "Ibid - Multi-protocol Bot"
.SH NAME
ibid-setup \- Create a basic configuration file and database for an Ibid
bot
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ibid-setup
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program sets up everything that a new Ibid bot needs before it can
run.
It asks a series of questions about the new bot, and writes out a basic
configuration file -
.BR ibid.ini (5)
- to the current directory.
It also creates a database for the bot, by default a SQLite database in
the current directory.
.P
This should be run in the directory which will become the new Ibid bot's
base.
.P
Should there be an existing \fBibid.ini\fR in the current directory, it
will be used, and the only questions asked will be for adding an
administrative user. These can safely be skipped with a \fB^C\fR.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I ibid.ini
The Ibid bot's configuration file, will be created if it doesn't exist.
