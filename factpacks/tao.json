   "<reply> Those who know don't talk./Those who talk don't know./Close your mouth,/block off your senses,/blunt your sharpness,/untie your knots,/soften your glare,/settle your dust./This is the primal identity./Be like the Tao./It can't be approached or withdrawn from,/benefited or harmed,/honored or brought into disgrace./It gives itself up continually./That is why it endures.", 
   "<reply> If a country is governed with tolerance,/the people are comfortable and honest./If a country is governed with repression,/the people are depressed and crafty./When the will to power is in charge,/the higher the ideals, the lower the results./Try to make people happy,/and you lay the groundwork for misery./Try to make people moral,/and you lay the groundwork for vice./Thus the Master is content/to serve as an example/and not to impose her will./She is pointed, but doesn't pierce./Straightforward, but supple./Radiant, but easy on the eyes.", 
   "<reply> The Tao never does anything,/yet through it all things are done./If powerful men and women/could venter themselves in it,/the whole world would be transformed/by itself, in its natural rhythms./People would be content/with their simple, everyday lives,/in harmony, and free of desire./When there is no desire,/all things are at peace.", 
   "<reply> When the great Tao is forgotten,/goodness and piety appear./When the body's intelligence declines,/cleverness and knowledge step forth./When there is no peace in the family,/filial piety begins./When the country falls into chaos,/patriotism is born.", 
   "<reply> All streams flow to the sea/because it is lower than they are./Humility gives it its power./If you want to govern the people,/you must place yourself below them./If you want to lead the people,/you must learn how to follow them./The Master is above the people,/and no one feels oppressed./She goes ahead of the people,/and no one feels manipulated./The whole world is grateful to her./Because she competes with no one,/no one can compete with her.", 
   "<reply> My teachings are easy to understand/and easy to put into practice./Yet your intellect will never grasp them,/and if you try to practice them, you'll fail./My teachings are older than the world./How can you grasp their meaning?/If you want to know me,/look inside your heart.", 
   "<reply> Not-knowing is true knowledge./Presuming to know is a disease./First realize that you are sick;/then you can move toward health./The Master is her own physician./She has healed herself of all knowing./Thus she is truly whole.", 
   "<reply> Nothing in the world/is as soft and yielding as water./Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible,/nothing can surpass it./The soft overcomes the hard;/the gentle overcomes the rigid./Everyone knows this is true,/but few can put it into practice./Therefore the Master remains/serene in the midst of sorrow./Evil cannot enter his heart./Because he has given up helping,/he is people's greatest help./True words seem paradoxical.", 
   "<reply> He who stands on tiptoe/doesn't stand firm./He who rushes ahead/doesn't go far./He who tries to shine/dims his own light./He who defines himself/can't know who he really is./He who has power over others/can't empower himself./He who clings to his work/will create nothing that endures./If you want to accord with the Tao,/just do your job, then let go."
